hello-world
===========

This is a fork (from visionlab, to grez72);

Now this is how I do it.

I guess this is where we meet for the first time. Hello, I love you.

I'm still not getting this exactly. I type this. I goto my github gui, I push. 

Then what happens?

OK, after I push, then I just refresh, and my changes appear. I thought these had to be 
validated somehow. Is that not the case?

What if I forked this thing, and I want to setup a pull request so the owner of the
original can choose to incorporate these changes?

To do that, I create a pull request. Then that owner decides, and if they choose
to merge, then their repository will be updated, and they can use the github gui 
to sync their local copy.
